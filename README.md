# somsphere ZZZ
## (Self Organizing Maps in spherical coordinates)

Just the piece (SOMZ) of code taken from [MLZ](https://github.com/mgckind/MLZ) to create Self Organizing Maps in different topologies (spherical, rectangular and hexagonal coordinates).

See Documentation [here](http://matias-ck.com/mlz/somz.html#somz2)

Paper Reference where this is introduced and used [here](http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5753)

## Installation

  pip install git+https://github.com/weqan/somspherez.git
 
It supports python2 and python3 

## Requirements

Beside standard libraries ([numpy](http://www.numpy.org/), [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/), [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/))  to run in spherical coordinates it also needs [healpy](https://healpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), a library to deal with spherical coordinates and spherical tesellations. This last requirement is optional

## Examples

See [here](Example.ipynb) for a notebook example on how to get started.
